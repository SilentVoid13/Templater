## Unicode characters (emojis, ...) are not working on Windows ?

`cmd.exe` and `powershell` on Windows are known to have problems with unicode characters.

You can check https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater/issues/15#issuecomment-824067020 for a solution.

Another good solution (probably the best) is to use [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701) and set it as the default shell in Templater's setting.
