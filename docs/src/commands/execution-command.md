# Javascript Execution Command

This type of command allows us to execute JavaScript code.

With a JavaScript Execution command, we can pretty much do everything that JavaScript allows us to do. Some examples are given below.

We can still access the `tp` object and all the internal variables / functions from this type of command.

JavaScript Execution commands let you access global namespace variables. This means you can access things like `app` or `moment`.

## Asynchronous functions

Some internal functions are asynchronous. When calling such functions inside a JavaScript execution command, don't forget to use the `await` keyword if necessary.

## How to output a value from a JavaScript Execution Command ?

Sometimes, you may want to output something when using a JS execution command. This is possible although a raw display / interpolation command is preferable.

When the [Eta](https://eta.js.org/) templating engine generates a replacement string using all of our commands results, it is stored in a variable named `tR`. This is the string that will contain the processed file content. You are allowed to access that variable from a JS execution command.

This means that, to output something from a JS execution command, you just need to append what you want to output to that `tR` string variable.

For example, the following command: `<%* tR += "test" %>` will output `test`.

### Suggesters and Prompts

It is important to note that the `tp.system.prompt()` and `tp.system.suggester()` both require a `await` statement to save the value to a variable

## Examples

Here are some examples of things you can do using JavaScript Execution Commands:

```javascript
<%* if (tp.file.title.startsWith("Hello")) { %>
This is a hello file !
<%* } else { %>
This is a normal file !
<%* } %>
    
<%* if (tp.frontmatter.type === "seedling") { %>
This is a seedling file !
<%* } else { %>
This is a normal file !
<%* } %>
    
<%* if (tp.file.tags.contains("#todo")) { %>
This is a todo file !
<%* } else { %>
This is a finished file !
<%* } %>

<%*
function log(msg) {
	console.log(msg);
}
%>
<%* log("Title: " + tp.file.title) %>
    
<%* tR += tp.file.content.replace(/stuff/, "things"); %>
```
